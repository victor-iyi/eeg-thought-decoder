Decoding human thoughts from EEG signals is a complex task that requires capturing
intricate spatial and temporal patterns in the brain's electrical activity.

Recent advancements in AI, particularly in Transformer architectures and Large
Language Models (LLMs), have shown remarkable capabilities in modelling sequential
and complex data patterns.

In this exposition, I present a mathematically detailed proof that human thoughts
can be decoded from EEG signals using a sophisticated Transformer-based AI model.
I incorporate elements from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
expert models, and agentic models to enhance the model's specialization and accuracy.
